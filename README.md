# Linear-regression-and-logistic-regression

**Overview:**

The task involves implementing and testing two supervised learning algorithms, linear regression and logistic regression, using Python. The primary focus is on data science skills, including data manipulation with Pandas, visualization with Matplotlib, and implementation of machine learning algorithms without relying on existing libraries for specific functionalities.

**Methodology:**

1. **Linear Regression:**
   - Utilize the Boston housing dataset, applying linear regression with direct solution and gradient descent.
   - Explore data using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Numpy.
   - Compute mean house prices, fraction of homes above $40k, and visualize data.
   - Derive a simple linear model for a single feature and implement it.
   - Extend to linear regression with multiple features (attributes).

2. **Logistic Regression:**
   - Use the breast cancer dataset for logistic regression.
   - Visualize data using Matplotlib.
   - Implement logistic regression from scratch using gradient descent.
   - Compare the results with scikit-learn's logistic regression.

**Implementation:**

1. **Linear Regression:**
   - Data loading and exploration.
   - Computation of mean house prices and fraction of homes above $40k.
   - Visualization of the relationship between the average number of rooms and house prices.
   - Derivation and implementation of a linear model for prediction.
   - Extension to linear regression with multiple features.

2. **Logistic Regression:**
   - Data loading and visualization.
   - Implementation of logistic regression using gradient descent.
